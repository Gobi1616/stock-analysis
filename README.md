## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of the project is to compare some green energy stocks in addition to Daqo New Energy Corporation's stocks and to identify the best green energy stocks, and diversifying Steve’s parent’s funds. Daqo is a company that makes silicon wafers for solar panels. VBA is an extension to Excel to automate the task, and it will allow Steve to reuse it with any stock. 

## Results

## Summary   

Since Steve’s parents are planning to invest all their money in Daqo New Energy Corporation, based data from above mentioned table,  in 2017 DQ’s the total daily volume is 35,796,200 and ROI is 199.4 %, and it is the highest return among the all-green energy stocks. But in 2018, DQ’s ROI is decreased to – 62.6% even its volume is increased to 107,873,900, and this not good sign to invest in DQ’s stocks.  RUN’s energy stocks have a rapid growth in its volume and ROI. In 2018, its volume increased from 267,861,300 to 502,757,100 and ROI increased from 5.5% to 84% which is a good growth. Moreover, ENPH has a slide decrease in its ROI from 129.5% to 81.9% in 2018. Even though the ROI downturned, still Steve’s parents can invest and get the return since the volume inclined from 221,772,100 to 607,473,500 and the ROI is still positive which is compared with other stocks. Increase stocks shows that, investors invested more in the stock of ENPH in 2018. 
Steve can advise his parents to invest in RUN and ENPH by diversifying the funds. He can advise them to invest 70% in RUN and 30% ENPH. 

### Advantages of Code Refactoring:

- Extensible Code
Code Refactoring helps in generate more flexibility of the code with the capability of codes. To add many more other functions, code refactoring makes the code more extensible.

- Maintainability
It is less complex and easier to maintain because the code is fresh after refactoring. 

### Disadvantages of Code Refactoring:

- Time Consuming
We have no estimate of how long it will take to accomplish the process. This could also put everyone in some kind of a position because we do not know what to do next.

- Chance of Mistakes
If something goes wrong, we'll have to spend a lot more time fixing it, and there's a good possibility it would go incorrect due to the code's uncertainty.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

When the refactoring may not always be the same as the original developer, refactoring can be challenging. As a result, he or she lacks the same understanding of the structure and the decisions that led to its creation. You still run the risk of introducing bugs into another new model that just wasn't present throughout the original. While refactoring is essential, it keeps the structure of the code clean and workable. It also decreases the number of bugs in general. This detracts from processing time. This may also trigger cumulates upgrade conflicts in code that would be a user of the error-handling code, causing problems with some SCMs.
